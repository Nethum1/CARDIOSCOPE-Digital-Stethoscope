# CARDIOSCOPE-(Digital-Stethoscope)
CARDIOSCOPE is a digital stethoscope that captures heart sounds using a stethoscope sensor and processes them with an ESP32 microcontroller. It records real-time heart signals and sends the data to a computer for analysis. A machine learning model analyzes the audio to help detect abnormal heart patterns for early cardiac monitoring.

## Introduction
Digital Stethoscope aims at producing an electronics based amplifying stethoscope, which can store/ transmit the sound waveform captured to another device. Some of the advantages and motivation to switch from mechanically to electronically based amplifying are :
- Better amplification, and a more flexible range of amplification
- Noise reduction capabilities 
- Ability to store and transmit sound captures in order to analyse them on a later date

## Objectives 
The main goals have set out for this project are 
- Make a microphone - amplification module that can detect frequencies from 50Hz to 20kHz 
- Transmit the sound clip to an associated laptop wirelessly 
- Be able to detect the disease by using an associated Deep Learning model <hr>

<p>The microcontroller that we are using in our project is the ESP32.
The ESP32 is a high-performance microcontroller board that is widely used in Internet of Things (IoT) applications.
Espressif Systems manufactures it, and it is the successor to the ESP8266. The ESP32 is built around a dual-core 
Tensilica LX6 processor that operates at up to 240 MHz, providing plenty of processing power for IoT applications.
</p>

The ESP32 microcontroller board has the following key features:
<ol>
<li>
    <em>Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity:</em> The ESP32 includes Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, making it simple to connect to the internet and other devices.
</li>
<li>
    <em> Low power consumption:</em> The ESP32 is energy-efficient, with multiple power modes that allow it to operate on very little power.
</li>
<li>
    <em> Large Memory:</em> The ESP32 comes up with up to 520 KB of SRAM and 4MB of flash memory, which is enough to run complex applications.
</li>
<li>
    <em>GPIO pins:</em> The ESP32 has a large number of GPIO pins, which makes it easy to interface with other devices and sensors.
</li>
<li>
    <em>Development tools:</em> There are many development tools available for it including Arduino IDE, ESP-IDF, and MicroPython.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Overall, the ESP32 is a powerful and versatile microcontroller board that is well-suited for a wide range of IoT applications. Its built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, low power consumption, and large memory make it a popular choice among developers.

In this project, the esp32 is used to transmit the data collected from the microphone to the ML model over the in-built Wi-Fi.
